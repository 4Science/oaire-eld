# Enrich local data via the OpenAIRE Graph

> The project is part of the OpenAIRE Open Innovation programme (https://www.openaire.eu/open-innovation-in-openaire), launched to discover, support and fund innovative ideas and implementations of software in the Open Science domain. The programme selected innovative projects in the field of Open Science to develop products and services linked to scholarly works, repositories, data management, OpenAIRE infrastructure, to create new services for the Open Science and EOSC ecosystem.

This website has been setup by [4Science](https://www.4science.it/en) to share the progress on the implementation and provide access to the resulting outputs.

The project implements two services to enhance local data with information in the OpenAIRE Research Graph. More specifically, one service, the [Data Correction](data-correction.md) aims to improve existing data in the repository using feedback that OpenAIRE made available via the Notification Broker Service, such as missing or additional metadata (abstract, subjects, PIDs, projects). The other service, [Publication claim](publication-claim.md) is focus on identified publications that are missing in the repository.
